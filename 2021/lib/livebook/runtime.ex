  An arbitrary term identifying an evaluation container.

  A container is an abstraction of an isolated group of evaluations.
  Containers are mostly independent and consequently can be evaluated
  concurrently if possible.

  Note that every evaluation can use the resulting environment
  and bindings of any previous evaluation, even from a different
  container.

  Sets the caller as runtime owner.

  It's advised for each runtime to have a leading process
  that is coupled to the lifetime of the underlying runtime
  resources. In this case the `connect` function may start
  monitoring that process and return the monitor reference.
  This way the caller is notified when the runtime goes down
  by listening to the :DOWN message.

  Asynchronously parses and evaluates the given code.

  The given `locator` identifies the container where
  the code should be evaluated as well as the evaluation
  reference to store the resulting contxt under.

  Additionally, `prev_locator` points to a previous
  evaluation to be used as the starting point of this
  evaluation. If not applicable, the previous evaluation
  reference may be specified as `nil`.

  ## Communication

  Evaluation outputs are sent to the connected runtime owner.
  The messages should be of the form:

    * `{:evaluation_output, ref, output}` - output captured
      during evaluation

    * `{:evaluation_response, ref, output, metadata}` - final
      result of the evaluation. Recognised metadata entries
      are: `evaluation_time_ms`

  The output may include input fields. The evaluation may then
  request the current value of a previously rendered input by
  sending `{:evaluation_input, ref, reply_to, input_id}` to the
  runtime owner, which is supposed to reply with `{:evaluation_input_reply, reply}`
  where `reply` is either `{:ok, value}` or `:error` if no matching
  input can be found.

  In all of the above `ref` is the evaluation reference.

  If the evaluation state within a container is lost (for example
  a process goes down), the runtime may send `{:container_down, container_ref, message}`
  to notify the owner.

  ## Options

    * `:file` - file to which the evaluated code belongs. Most importantly,
      this has an impact on the value of `__DIR__`.
